"2. Note that this table exhibits strong seasonality, largely due to the release of new registration plates in March and September each year. New registration statistics also closely reflect the wider state of the British economy - in general, figures are higher during periods of strong economic growth and lower during times of low growth or recession. These statistics can also be affected by government actions such as regulatory or administrative changes, and stimulus schemes. For further details, please refer to the quarterly releases and the notes and definitions referred to in footnote 1.",,,,,,,,,,,
